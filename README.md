# 🛍️ Diwali Sales Analysis

- A data analytics project using Python to analyze Diwali sales data and uncover valuable business insights related to customer behavior, product performance, and regional trends. 
- I used Python instead of Excel or Power BI for its flexibility, scalability, and ability to extract deeper, multi-dimensional insights from large datasets.

## 📁 Project Overview

This project involves end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The focus is on identifying which customer segments, regions, and product categories contributed most to Diwali sales.

### ✅ Key steps performed:

- **Data Loading & Cleaning**  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Analyzed data by:  
    - Gender  
    - Age group  
    - Marital status  
    - State and zone  
    - Occupation  
    - Product category  
    - Product ID

- **Data Visualization**  
  - Used `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create charts such as:  
    - Gender-wise spending  
    - Age group vs Total Amount  
    - State-wise orders and revenue  
    - Spending by occupation  
    - Product category insights  
    - Top 10 most sold products
