## 📁 Project Overview

This project involves end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The focus is on identifying which customer segments, regions, and product categories contributed most to Diwali sales.

### ✅ Key steps performed:

- **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
  - Loaded the CSV dataset using `pandas`
  - Removed irrelevant columns (`Status`, `unnamed1`)
  - Handled missing values and converted data types (e.g., `Amount` to integer)

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Analyzed data by:  
    - Gender  
    - Age group  
    - Marital status  
    - State and zone  
    - Occupation  
    - Product category  
    - Product ID

- **Data Visualization**  
  - Used `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create charts such as:  
    - Gender-wise spending  
    - Age group vs Total Amount  
    - State-wise orders and revenue  
    - Spending by occupation  
    - Product category insights  
    - Top 10 most sold products

- **Insight Generation**  
  - Identified the most valuable customer segments
  - Uncovered top-performing products and regions
  - Combined all factors to generate strategic insights
